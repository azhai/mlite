20141229 Fixed a bug that could cause ~= to crash when autoscaling failed.
20141217 Fixed to_radix (radix.m) for 0 input.
20141203 Fixed ntos for reals ending in ".0".
20141203 Fixed ~= and ~<> operators (auto-scaling before comparison now).
20141202 Fixed comparison (=,<>) of strings of unequal length.
20141202 Fixed precision of pi in trig.m. Thanks, Bruce!
20141201 Tentatively increased mantissa size to 36 digits.
20141201 Added n'th root function (nthroot) to core library.
20141127 Changed realnum semantics of ~<> and ~= ((not) approx. equal).
20141127 Fixed x^y with fractional y. Thanks, Bruce "Bugmagnet" Axtens!
20141124 Grouping does not work in implicit guards. No fix for now.
20141121 Made ^ reject fractional exponents with no useful approximation.
20141120 Made << and >> operators associate to the right.
20141119 Started test suite.
20141118 Added negative exponents in real number literals, e.g. 1e~5.
20141118 Added more multi-character char literals, like #"\"", etc.
20141116 Made the ^ operator accept a non-integer exponent.
20141112 Fixed broken real number parser. Thanks again, Bruce Axtens!
20141107 Fix: compiler missed some errors (currying in alternative patterns).
20141031 Closed a massive GC leak in the div and rem functions.
20141030 Protected redirected I/O streams from GC.
20141030 Made #! a comment to end of line.
20141027 Documented the foreach function. Thanks, Bruce Axtens!
20141027 Added the ntos and ston functions (num/str conversion). Thanks, Bruce!
20141018 Renamed library path environment variable (MLITE_LIBRARY_PATH).
20141018 Made :: a valid type name in constructors, e.g. type :x = :y (::)
20141014 Fixed a bug that could crash the compiler. Thanks, James Turner!
20141014 Removed POSIX prelude (not required).
